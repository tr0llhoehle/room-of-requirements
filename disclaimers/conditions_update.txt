DISPUTES

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any RoR Service, or to any services distributed by RoR will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
